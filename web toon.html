    <h2 style="color: blue; font-size: x-large;">aboutgame:</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Theft Auto V is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, mainly around the city of Los Santos, which is inspired by Los Angeles. The story follows three main characters — Michael De Santa, a retired bank robber living a luxurious but unhappy life; Franklin Clinton, a young street hustler looking for a better future; and Trevor Philips, a violent criminal and Michael’s unpredictable former partner.

Michael and Franklin meet when Franklin tries to repossess Michael’s son’s car. Impressed by Franklin’s potential, Michael takes him under his wing. But when a jewelry store robbery draws the attention of old enemies, Trevor discovers that Michael, who he believed to be dead, is actually alive.

Trevor tracks Michael down, and soon the three men begin working together again on a series of dangerous heists. They face corrupt government agents, rival criminals, and their own personal conflicts. Each of them wants something different — Michael seeks peace, Franklin wants success, and Trevor desires freedom and chaos.

As their crimes grow bigger, tensions rise between them. In the end, Franklin is forced to make a difficult decision: to kill Michael, to kill Trevor, or to risk everything to save both. Depending on the choice, the story ends with either betrayal or one final job where all three fight side by side before going their separate ways. </p>
