    <h1 style="color: darkgoldenrod;"> what is html?</h1>
    <p> <b>HTML</b> (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard <i>language</i> used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for web pages, allowing developers to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. Every web page you see on the internet is built using HTML as its foundation.

HTML uses tags to organize content and tell the browser how to display different elements. <mark>For example,</mark> defines a heading, defines a paragraph, and is used to insert an image. These tags help browsers interpret and render web content properly across different devices and platforms.

The main uses of HTML include creating website layouts, embedding media<del> (like videos and images), </del>and linking to other pages or resources through hyperlinks. It also serves as the base structure that works together with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to create complete, dynamic, and visually appealing websites. </p>
