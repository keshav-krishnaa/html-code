        shows; death toll at 13</h2>

    <p class="nation">The death toll in the car explosion near New Delhi’s Red Fort stands at 13, and the investigation
        has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Initial investigation, as of Tuesday (November
        11, 2025), seems to suggest a doctor from Pulwama was likely the sole occupant of the vehicle that exploded on
        Monday (November 10). The bomb was “premature” as the person was said to be acting in haste due to pressure of
        police raids that had already led to the arrest of two colleagues.

        The Lal Quila Metro Station will remain closed on Wednesday (November 12) as a precautionary measure, in view of
        heightened security across the national capital following the explosion. All other stations are functional as
        normal, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said on social media.

        A woman doctor, identified as Shaheen Saeed (40), was arrested from Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday (November 11),
        a J&K Police source said. This is the eight arrest in the “terror module” case, even as at least 20 others
        continue to be questioned in the Valley. The Red Fort car explosion was preceded by a 20-day-long probe in J&K
        linked to two terror outfits including Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).</p><br>

    <h2 class="sports biu" >FIDE files formal complaint with ethics commission against former world champion Kramnik</h2><br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="sports biu">Kramnik had made repeated public allegations of cheating against Daniel Naroditsky, who later
        died</h3><br>
    <img src="sports.jpg" alt="" class="img" id="a">
    <br><span class="upt">updated</span>
    <span class="time">-12-11-2025,12:30pm</span>
    <p class="sports">The complaint outlines a pattern of conduct over roughly two years and cites several public
        statements and materials that FIDE considers relevant to potential violations related to harassment and the
        insulting of an individual’s dignity.

        "The submission also includes testimony and information provided by David Navara and people close to Daniel
        Naroditsky. These matters will now be reviewed under the established procedures of the EDC." World number one
        Magnus Carlsen, American star Hikaru Nakamura and Indian GM Nihal Sarin have been among the most vocal players
        in raising concerns about the impact that Kramnik's allegations had on Naroditsky.

        FIDE said the referral comes after a review of the matter by its Management Board.</p>
