      HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the basic structure of a webpage by using a system of elements and tags. These tags define different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists. Every HTML document begins with a !DOCTYPE html declaration, which tells the browser that the file is an HTML5 document, followed by the html, head, and body sections that organize the content and metadata.
The structure of an HTML document is both simple and powerful. The head section contains information about the webpage, such as its title, links to stylesheets, and metadata that help search engines and browsers interpret the page. The body section contains the actual content that users see on their screens—such as text, images, videos, and interactive elements. HTML uses nested tags to organize this content hierarchically, ensuring that browsers can render it properly.
Over time, HTML has evolved through several versions, with HTML5 being the latest major standard. HTML5 introduced new elements like header, footer, article, and section to make web pages more semantic and accessible. It also supports multimedia content directly with the audio and video tags, eliminating the need for external plugins. Combined with CSS and JavaScript, HTML forms the foundation of all modern websites, enabling developers to create interactive, visually appealing, and well-structured web experiences. </p>
